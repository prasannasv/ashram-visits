[] GET /?id=<program id> should return Page 1 and the list of all program participant relationship id, participant name, number & check-in status
[] Page 1 should show a form that asks for name or number
[] Page 1's javascript should create buttons with participant names and color as blue if they have already checked-in and plain otherwise. All the buttons should be hidden to begin with.
[] Page 1's javascript should listen for key type events and hide / show buttons with participant names that has any of the letters specified in the search
[] Page 1's buttons should be clickable and the action on click should hide the search form and show them the page 2 for the participant based on the program participant relationship id
 - to do this, it will do a GET on /api/check_in?pgm_part_id=<program participant id>
[] Page 2 will show all the fields of the participant and have a button to Save and another button called Back to Check in
[] Back to Check in button will disable page 2 and enable page 1's div
[] Save button will call POST /api/check_in with body containing all the form params. Once saved, a status gets sent back which will be shown in the alert div. Type is based on status of the call.
[] Searching by number in Page 1 should do the same filtering but instead by the number
[] Page 1 should have a Clear button that clears the content of the input fields and takes the control to the name input field
[] Gate it behind login
